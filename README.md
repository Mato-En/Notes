# Preface
- All notes are free to edit, share, and whatever you like to do with it
- I am no expert in neither of the fields so mistakes happen and if you find one, feel free to let me know
# Installation Process 
- I use [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) because it offers great Latex integration and I especially like that it is free and opensource
- After downloading the program, I recommend downloading the following plugins
  - Better Code Blocks: some notes contain programming code
  - Joplin Enhancement: very important as it allows to scale the images 
  - Text Colorize: used for highlighting important parts of the notes
- With these plugins installed, you can import the .jex file (**unfortunately**: the import will be nested within a notebook with the name of the file. Simply give the parent another appropriate name or move it and delete the parent)
# Subjects
## Mathematics
### Calculus
- All notes were created from reading the Calculus volumes from [Openstax](https://openstax.org/subjects/math) and from internet research regarding unanswered questions. Huge thank you for making them available for free!
- Every mathematician would roll their eyes at what I sometimes call a proof but these notes are written from the perspective of a (becoming) physicst not a mathematician
- The section _Preliminaries_ is actually from the _Mathematical Analysis Second Edition Apostol_ but this level of mathematical rigor does not continue
### Precalculus
- All notes were created from reading the Algebra and Trigonometry book from [Openstax](https://openstax.org/subjects/math) and from internet research regarding unanswered questions. Again, very gratetful for their work.
- These notes do not include any proofs and are solely used to gain a solid understanding of basic mathematical concepts needed for reading the calculus notes
