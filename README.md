# Preface
- All notes are free to edit, share, or whatever you like to do with it
- I wrote these notes for myself but I provide them here as it is no additional effort. Also, I am no expert in any of the fields so mistakes happen and if you find one, feel free to let me know
- Note that these notes are meant to be viewed in fullscreen (i.e., third editor mode) and on a computer
# Installation Process 
- I use [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) because it offers great Latex integration and I especially like that it is free and opensource
- After downloading the program, I recommend downloading the following plugins
  - Better Code Blocks: some notes contain programming code
  - Joplin Enhancement: very important as it allows to scale the images 
  - Text Colorize: used for highlighting important parts of the notes
- With these plugins installed, you can import the .jex file (**unfortunately**: the import will be nested within a notebook with the name of the file. Simply give the parent another appropriate name or move it and delete the parent)
# Subjects
## Mathematics
### Precalculus
- All notes were created from reading the Algebra and Trigonometry book from [Openstax](https://openstax.org/subjects/math) and from internet research regarding unanswered questions. Again, very gratetful for their work.
- These notes do not include any proofs and are solely used to gain a solid understanding of basic mathematical concepts needed for reading the calculus notes
#### Topics
- Topics include (among others)
  - Preliminaries: exponents, radicals, and polynomials
  - Functions: linear functions, transformation of functions, polynomial and rational functions, and exponential and logarithmic functions
  - Trigonometry: right triangles, trigonometric functions and their graphs, trigonometric identities, law of sines and cosines, and polar coordinates
  - System of equations: system of linear and non linear equations, matrices and their operations, solving system of equations (Gaussian elimination, inverses, and determinants)
  - Analytic geometry: conic sections and rotation of axes
  - Counting theory: permutations and combinations, and the binomial theorem
### Calculus
- All notes were created from reading the Calculus volumes from [Openstax](https://openstax.org/subjects/math) and from internet research regarding unanswered questions. Huge thank you for making them available for free!
- Every mathematician would roll their eyes at what I sometimes call a proof but these notes are written from the perspective of a (becoming) physicst not a mathematician
- The section _Preliminaries_ is actually from the _Mathematical Analysis Second Edition Apostol_ but this level of mathematical rigor does not continue
- As the topics advance, proofs are not provided as frequently as they were at the beginning (derivations are mostly included) since they are covered in real analysis books
#### Topics
- Topics include (among others)
  - Preliminaries: definition of real and complex numbers
  - Limits: limit laws, continuity and epsilon-delta definition
  - Derivatives: differentiation rules, derivatives of trigonometric and exponential functions, and finding extrema of a function
  - Integration: integration rules, fundamental theorem of calculus, integration by parts, trigonometric integrals, and improper integrals
  - Differential equations: finding solutions to first- and second order (in progress) differential equations
  - Series: infinite series, alternating series, root and ratio test, and power series (specifically, Taylor and Maclaurin series)
  - Multivariate calculus: partial derivatives, tangent planes, double and triple integrals
  - Vector calculus: planes, vectors, line integrals, surface integrals, and Stokes' theorem (in progress) 
## Physics
- In progress
